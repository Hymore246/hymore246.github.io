Public Repository for the Warrior Sheath Designer tool

ABOUT
The Warrior Sheath Designer was created by Hymore.
This is a tool that helps design of warrior sheaths. The tool was made for the Gemstone 4 community
and is free to use and open sourced. The tool uses only HTML and client side javascript. Meaning, it
doesn't need an internet connection to function. The designer can be used offline by downloading
the HTML page and opening it in a web browser.
